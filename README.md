This repository contains some tooling that can be used to quickly
obtain information about how websites use the
[U.S. Web Design Standards][uswds].

## Quick start

You'll need [Node JS][].

```
npm install
node cache-sites.js
```

At this point, the front page of all sites that use the Standards
will be cached in the `cache` directory. At this point you can
run queries, described below.

## Queries

### Finding bad gov banners

To find sites that are using [bad gov banners][], run:

```
node find-bad-govbanners.js
```

[bad gov banners]: https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/issues/1738

## Clearing and re-populating the cache

To clear your cached copies of the front pages of all Standards sites,
just delete the `cache` directory, e.g. `rm -rf cache`.

Then run `node cache-sites.js` to re-populate the cache with the latest
version of each page.

## Updating the site list

The site list is stored in the [`WHO_IS_USING_USWDS.md`][] file in
the Standards repository. To change the version of the repository
used to obtain the list, change the `uswds` dependency in `package.json`.
